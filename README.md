# CoderHack

## Introduction
CoderHack is a RESTful API service developed using Spring Boot, designed to manage the Leaderboard for a Coding Platform. It utilizes MongoDB for data persistence and is tailored for a specific coding contest with its unique leaderboard and award system.


## Features
- **CRUD Operations:** Handles create, read, update, and delete operations for user registrations in the coding contest.
- **User Registration:** Accepts User ID and Username for registration. New users start with a score of 0 and no badges.
- **Score Update:** Allows updating the user's score via PUT requests.
- **Badge Award System:** Users receive badges (Code Ninja, Code Champ, Code Master) based on their scores.
- **User Retrieval:** Retrieves users sorted by score, with a sorting time complexity of O(nlogn).
- **Error Handling:** Includes validation for fields and handles common HTTP errors.


## Endpoints
